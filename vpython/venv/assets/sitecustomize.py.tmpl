# This file is added to `vpython`-generated VirtualEnvs in order for scripts run
# in this VirtualEnv via vpython to circle back to the vpython binary which
# invoked them. This allows python scripts invoked by vpython in some
# environment "X" to invoke other scripts, using sys.executable, in environment
# "Y", simply by using sys.executable.

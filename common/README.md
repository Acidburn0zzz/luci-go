luci-go: LUCI in Go: shared code
================================

[![GoDoc](https://godoc.org/github.com/luci/luci-go/common?status.svg)](https://godoc.org/github.com/luci/luci-go/common)

This directory contains code and structures shared between all of
`/appengine/...`, `/client/...` and `/server/...`; for example, the structures
used by the server APIs. These are inherently APIs.

//
// Due to a bug/feature in goconvey[1], files in this package end in
// `_tests.go`.
//
// This is a signal to goconvey's internal stack traversal logic (used to print
// helpful assertion messages) that the assertions in this package should be
// considered 'testing code' and not 'tested code', and so should be skipped
// over when searching for the first stack frame containing the code under test.

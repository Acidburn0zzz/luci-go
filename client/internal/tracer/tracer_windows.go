import "syscall"

// increaseClockFrequency increases the clock rate from default 15.6ms to 1ms.
//
// This makes Bruce unhappy* but this is useful on Windows to get accurate
// measurements while collecting traces without having to use the high
// frequency timer. This is NOT strictly necessary and the code will work
// just fine without but the use case for this package is sub 10ms spans, so
// it's recommended and done by default.
//
// This function is only useful on Go 1.6 and later, on Windows, since before
// the call was done automatically on startup of every Go process. See
// https://golang.org/doc/go1.6#runtime for more information.
//
// An alternative is to use QueryPerformanceCounter() but that means using a
// kernel function call insted of reading userland memory, like time.Now(),
// which calls runtime.unixnano() that reads memory at an hard coded location.
// Calling into kernel land further increases implicit synchronization, this is
// why this code prefers to increase the timer resolution than constantly
// switch into kernel mode.
//
// On the other hand, if someone wants sub-millisecond resolution,
// QueryPerformanceCounter() should be used since it can return Âµs resolution
// time measurement.

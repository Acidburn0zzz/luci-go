  <h1>Welcome to LogDog!</h1>

  <section>
    <!-- Introduction -->
    <div>
      <p>LogDog is an ongoing Chrome Infrastructure Team project to stream,
      collect, archive, and serve Chromium build logs and associated data. It is
      part of the larger <a href="https://github.com/luci">LUCI</a> project.</p>

      <p><strong>Note: LogDog is currently in development.</strong> It is being
      rolled out to select Chromium project waterfalls to exercise the system
      under load and collect real-world data for other LUCI systems to use.</p>

      <p>While there is developer aim to keep its APIs, data format, and data
      archives stable, Chrome Infra may need to disrupt some or all of these
      during development and preparation for production deployment.</p>
    </div>

    <!-- FAQ -->
    <div>
      <h1>How do I contact the LogDog/LUCI team?</h1>
      <p>Send e-mails or requests to
      <a href="mailto:infra-dev@chromium.org">infra-dev@chromium.org</a>.
    </div>

    <div>
      <h1>Where are the LogDog APIs?</h1>

      </p>LogDog supports interaction via
      <a href="https://github.com/luci/luci-go/tree/master/common/prpc">pRPC</a>,
      a gRPC-inspired protocol. It supports <strong>JSON</strong> and
      <strong>Protocol Buffers</strong> formats.</p>

      <p>You can try its APIs with the <a href="/rpcexplorer/">RPC Explorer</a>!
    </div>

    <div>
      <h1>How long is log data stored?</h1>

      </p>LogDog currently stores log data indefinitely in
      <a href="https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/overview">Google Cloud
        Storage</a>. It is accessible immediately through LogDog APIs. If
      programmatic log data access is needed, please contact the Chrome
      Infrastructure team..</p>
    </div>

    <div>
      <h1>What sort of data is LogDog good for?</h1>

      <p>LogDog is designed for any sort of streaming data. It supports three
      data formats:
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Text</strong>: Newline-delimited lines of UTF8 text.</li>
          <li><strong>Binary</strong>: A single binary stream (e.g., file).</li>
          <li><strong>Datagram</strong>: A series of length-prefixed binary
            blobs.</li>
        </ul>

        <aside>Chances are your data will fit into one of those three formats.
        </aside>
      </p>

      <p>LogDog streams are expected to terminate within a "reasonable" period
      of time. This period is currently set to <strong>1 day</strong>, but will
      likely be extended on release. If your data stream takes longer than this
      to send, please contact
      <a href="mailto:infra-dev@chromium.org">infra-dev@chromium.org</a> so we
      can discuss your use case.</p>

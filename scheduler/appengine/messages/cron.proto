  //     The cron engine will attempt to start a job at specified moments in
  //     time (based on UTC clock). If when triggering a job, previous
  //     invocation is still running, an overrun will be recorded (and next
  //     attempt to start a job happens based on the schedule, not when the
  //     previous invocation finishes). Some examples:
  //       "0 */3 * * * *" - each 3 hours: at 12:00 AM UTC, 3:00 AM UTC, ...
  //       "0 */3 * * *" - exact same thing (last field is optional)
  //       "0 2,10,18 * * *" - at 2 AM UTC, 10 AM UTC, 6 PM UTC
  //       "0 7 * * *" - at 7 AM UTC, once a day.
  //   - "with 10s interval": runs invocations in a loop, waiting 10s after
  //     finishing invocation before starting a new one. Overruns are not
  //     possible.
  //   - "continuously" is alias for "with 0s interval", meaning the job will
  //     run in a loop without any pauses.
  //   - "triggered" schedule indicates that job is only started via "Run now"
  //     button or via a trigger.
